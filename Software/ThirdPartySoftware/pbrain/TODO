 * Find data.008 w/ data.008.bni

 * Allow ffts on arbitrary length eegs by loading data piecewise

 * Fix threshold problem

 * Use BMSI from web

 * Put slider and channel selector for in the evoked matplotlib win

 * Deal with duplicate channel nums in Kolasa's BNI - improve BNI
   reading

 * Allow EOI save to filesystem even when use web is on

 * Allow new EOI events

 * Allow for multiple colormaps for leo

 * Allow for different pipe interpolations for leo

 * DONE 2004-01-13 - Allow electrode pick from loc3d window

 * DONE 2004-01-13 - View3 text toggle broken

 * Allow enter of selected electrode with text box

 * Something is whacked out in the way the label and pick happen with
   Kolasa's seizure fileunt

 * Use different gain for scalp electrodes using 10-20 name scalp
   scalp http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/dataformats/electrocap/

 * Rotate normals of pipes when 1D strips rotate

 * Fix grid manager prefer problem with radio buttons

 * Fix scalar from file open button -it's a marker load data button
   which belongs elsewhere. Add a marker tab which allows you to
   control marker properties (size, marker file, etc)

 * With multiple view3 windows, share computations as events.  Cache
   by eoi and timelim.  Share properties as well if auto is on??  
   How to share thresholding.  Should we have a single grid manager
   with multiple windows using it?

 * Warn when a new electrode is close to an existing electrode.

 * Fix movie view3 interb seg fault when IPWs not loaded

 * allow wheel scroll of plane under point.
